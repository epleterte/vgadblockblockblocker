vgadblockblockblocker
=====================

A userscript that battles adblock detection - made for www.vg.no :godmode:

vg.no detects adblock use and kindly asks you to reconsider and enable ads

if you don't feel like reconsidering because you are happy with your choice
or if you reconsider and still don't want ads
there is no way to let the ugly header frame ad nagger know you're done considering, no way to make it go away.

...until now. This userscript allows you to stick to your choices. Block the adblock blocker/detector. No means no. :see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:
